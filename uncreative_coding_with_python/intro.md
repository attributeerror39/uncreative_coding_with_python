# (Un-)Creative Coding with Python

»(Un-)Creative Coding with Python« teaches programming skills with Python from the ground up. This easy-to-learn general purpose programming language is used in many areas from image processing, parametric design to web scraping, data processing and machine learning. Python can be used to write stand-alone programs, but it can also be used as a scripting language to extend the functions of many software applications (Blender, Grasshopper, Touchdesigner, etc.).

We start with the installation and setup of a code editor before working on the following aspects using code examples and programming tasks: Syntax, variables, data types, functions, loops, control structures, input/output of data/media, external libraries.
