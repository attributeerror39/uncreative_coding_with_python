## Jupyter Notebooks & Jupyter Lab


[Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) are a great way to combine code and its output with documentary text and images all in one document. It's also great for developing code, as you can execute blocks of code and see/ visualize the result inside the notebook.

(The material for this seminar has the form of a [JupyterBook](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html). It consists of Jupyter Notebooks and Markdown-Files, rendered as HTML.)

### Run Jupyter Lab

After we have installed Jupyter Lab, we can run it from within our **activated** environment with the command:

```shell
# run jupyter lab
# (activate the environment first)
jupyter lab
```

Depending on your needs there are some additional arguments like:

```shell
jupyter lab --browser = False
```
