We believe that technology is not a byproduct to society, but an integral part of it. Rejecting technology is not an option; integrating it more holistically is. Our technological developments are the source of many of our greatest achievements as a species, but they have also enabled some of our most shameful atrocities. The technology we produce is very powerful, increasingly dangerous, and able to exercise ever greater influence over us both as individuals and as a society. Thus, it is necessary to evaluate how the tools we use will work for our individual and collective betterment â€” and not our debasement. We believe that local communities must determine what their technological society looks like, not global for-profit corporations or governments. Ethics must guide us: we think there are tools which enable us to do things that we as a society should decide will not be done. Speed and convenience do not trump all other values. Self-determination and privacy are fundamental, non-negotiable principles.
